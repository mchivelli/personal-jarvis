## Tool Confirmation Flow

When you say something that needs tools:

1. You: *"Send an email to John"*
2. Assistant: *"I will execute tools to handle: 'Send an email to John'. Do you want me to proceed?"*
3. You say: **"yes"** or **"no"**
4. Tools execute or cancel accordingly

**Quick confirm/cancel keywords:**
- **Confirm**: yes, yeah, yep, sure, ok, okay, confirm, go ahead, do it, proceed
- **Cancel**: no, nope, cancel, stop, don't, nevermind
